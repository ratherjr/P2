Functions

As a group and using Git/Github, write a program that plays the womenâ€™s soccer season as defined in Assignment 4. Modify the code to use functions as defined below. You can do more than what is required.

Everyone works on a Main function that calls other functions. Create the following functions:

NOTE: We want at least 5 functions and we definitely want the functions that get the home team name and the opponent name (removing the home team name). After that, make sure the game works. You can use your creativity to get this completed.

 

1. Display an introduction to the game explaining rules and prompt for their name and display that in the welcome message. Return the name to the main program and store it in variable so it can be used throughout the program.

2. Display of menu and return choice. Store in variable and use this value to determine which function to call next.

3. Display list of all teams and allow the user to choose a team using a menu. Call the function again to let the user choose the opponent but do not display the team they chose previously. Remove that team from the list. Allow the user to select an opponent, and return team name. This function should receive a parameter but give it a default value if none is passed. You can use this function for both choosing the home team and the opponent team.

4. Play the game receiving both team names. Generate random scores without ties. Return W or L.

5. Display the final record for a team. Receive the home team data and display information.

NOTE: If there are more team members than functions that need to be created then the main function can be created by one individual.
